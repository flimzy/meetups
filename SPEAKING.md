# Speaking at the Golang Amsterdam meetup

Excellent, you're giving a talk at the Golang Amsterdam meetup. The
community needs people like you!

# Topics

Talks can be about all kinds of topics, as long as they are related to
Go. Perhaps about some thing about Go you (dis)like. A library or program
you wrote in Go. Or your experience switching from another language to Go
(or vice versa!). How to do a certain thing in Go, like benchmarking,
debugging, etc.

We always try to keep the meetup interesting for both beginners and
advanced Go users. Beginners may have barely written an "hello world",
advanced users may be debugging performance problems deep in the
runtime. Keep this in mind for your talk. Don't assume everyone will
know as much as you. But you don't have to be a Go expert. The story of
a beginner in Go can be very valuable!

# Lighting and full talks

A typical meetup has a few short lightning talks (5-10 minutes), and
one or two longer talks (20-30 minutes). If your talk does not fit in this
category, don't worry, we can always work out an interesting schedule.

We typically show a timer for the speaker. It shows the number of minutes
you have been talking. The background changes from green to red the
more you get to your allotted time. Don't worry if you go over/under time
though. Don't rush your talk. It is typically best to have a topic that
you can skip if really needed. Of course it helps to practice with the
timer. See [timer.html](timer.html), make sure your device doesn't go
into sleep mode!

Speakers often initially prepare more content than fits in the time period. A 5
minute lightning talk really is very short. With 1 minute per slide, that
amounts to 5 slides. This also means it's relatively easy to get started with
speaking with a lightning talk. Just think of a topic and you've filled 5
minutes before you know it. The challenge is usually to not stretch it beyond
10 minutes!

People will have questions about your talk. It's best to leave a few
minutes for questions after a lightning talk, and about 5 minutes for full
talks.

# Slides

Most speakers prepare slides. Showing some actual Go code is appreciated
too of course. Be sure to send your slides at least one day before the
event to the main event organizer. It is typically the person listed
first as organizer for an event. If you only have slides, and don't need
to show/edit/compile code, you can use the organizer's laptop during
the event. The organizer will have everything ready for you. This makes
switching speakers quick and effortless. If you do need your own laptop,
this is fine too. Please test before the event starts that your laptop
can connect to the projector properly, so switching speakers is smooth.

# At the event

Please arrive early at the event! At least one organizer will always be
earlier than the official "doors open" time, to set up. By being early,
you can check the equipment. If issues pop up, you'll have time to fix
them. And we always enjoy having a chat with the speakers!

Keep in mind that last minute issues may change the order of the
talks. If you would like to go first, last or middle, please let the
organizers know!

# Speaking in public

Giving talks can be scary. Especially the first time. Some advice:
practice, practice, practice. But don't memorize exactly what you're going
to say: it's hard to recover if you forget what you want to say exactly
(which can happen with a bit of healthy stress). It's easier to put the
main points on each slide and be able to talk about those points. Don't
put too much text in there: no full sentences, just keywords are best.

Recording yourself is also a great way to see what you can improve. It
may be awkward, but you'll catch your "ehms" and mannerisms, though it
still takes practice to get rid of them.

Most of all: your speaking doesn't have to be perfect. We're all friendly
fellow gophers interested in what you have to say.

There are tons of resources available online with advice on speaking in
public. Many have gone before you! If you would like help/advice/practice,
feel free to contact the organizers.
