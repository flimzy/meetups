We have a recurring item during the meetup called "What's new in Go". We go
through the latest discussions/changes in the world of Go.

The format is a 5-10 minute talk listing the highlights of the changes. You
don't have to talk about ALL the changes. Just a few interesting ones that
stand out.

These talks are ideally given by people from the Go Amsterdam meetup community,
not always the organizers.
